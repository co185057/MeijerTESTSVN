The acsapldr.exe should be delivered by the ACS group. We need to coordinate the delivery
of that executable so that we can include it into any custom FastLane build we have to do.

The alternative is for the ACS group to own the acsapldr.exe (which they do) AND the
flacsapldr.bat file (which they could) and install these files as part of a FastLane
terminal installation. This work needs to be done.
